# Q&A

- Q: Why does the link say "hooks.hyra.io?"
- __A: Discord blocks requests from ROBLOX, so the script uses another proxy.

- Q: I need a webhook system that is particular to my game, but I don't know Lua. What should I do?
- __A: If you would like a customized script, please make a new issue in the issues tab.

- Q: The script isn't working! What should I do?
- __A: Make sure everything is formatted correctly, "Allow HTTP Requests" is enabled, the script is a normal script in ServerScriptService, and you don't have the link set to "discord.com." If it is still not working, please make an issue in the issues tab.

- Q: My question isn't here. What should I do?
- __A: Make a new question in the issues tab.
